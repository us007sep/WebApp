Advantages of React Hook Forms

1. have a object student, you need to update a particular data member as in marks
    clone student
    update marks of cloned students
    update student from clone student

    React Hooks Forms help us here
    By directly using setters and getters
    SetValue("marks",100)

    This is called state management

2. Validation
    Compulsary fields in Forms
    E-Mail contains @domain.com

    React Hook Forms helps disabling the button when user does not fills the compulsary fields

3. reset, watch
    Reset helps reset the Forms
